     PURPOSE
     STLEZ offers easy use of the STL  procedure  by  defaulting  most
     parameters values.
     SYNOPSIS
     stlez(y, n, np, ns, isdeg, itdeg, robust, no, rw, season,
             trend, work)
     integer n, np, ns, no isdeg, itdeg
     real y(n), rw(n), season(n), trend(n), work(n+2*np,7)
     logical robust
     ARGUMENTS
     y       input, time series to be decomposed.
     n       input, number of values in y.
     np      input, the period of the seasonal component. For example,
             if  the  time series is monthly with a yearly cycle, then
             np=12.
     ns      input, length of the seasonal smoother.  The value of  ns
             should be an odd integer greater than or equal to 3; ns>6
             is recommended.   As  ns  increases  the  values  of  the
             seasonal component at a given point in the seasonal cycle
             (e.g., January values of a monthly series with  a  yearly
             cycle) become smoother.
     isdeg   input, degree of locally-fitted  polynomial  in  seasonal
             smoothing.  The value is 0 or 1.
     itdeg   input,  degree  of  locally-fitted  polynomial  in  trend
             smoothing.  The value is 0 or 1.
     robust  input, .true. if robustness iterations are  to  be  used,
             .false. otherwise.
     rw      output, final  robustness  weights.   All  rw  are  1  if
             robust=.false.
     season  output, seasonal component.
     trend   output, trend component.
     no      output, number of robustness iterations.  The  iterations
             end if a convergence criterion is met or if the number is
             15.
     work    workspace of (n+2*np)*7 locations.

     STLEZ sets parameters to the  values  recommended  in  the  above
     reference.   Thus if you call STLEZ, you will be using the values
     summarized below.  See documentation for STL for  definitions  of
     the parameters.
     nt = smallest odd integer greater than or equal to
                         (1.5*np) / (1-(1.5/ns)).
     nl = smallest odd integer greater than or equal to np.
     nsjump = ns/10; ntjump = nt/10; nljump = nl/10.
     ni = 2 if robust=.false.; else ni=1.
     no = 0 if robust=.false.; else robustness iterations are  carried
     out until convergence of both seasonal and trend components, with
     15 iterations maximum.  Convergence occurs if the maximum changes
     in  individual  seasonal  and  trend fits are less than 1% of the
     component's range after the previous iteration.
